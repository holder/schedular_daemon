Awesome! Now that you've created a scheduler, you can test it out with:

  bundle exec scheduler_daemon run

to run it in the background (a la system start-up):

  bundle exec scheduler_daemon start


You'll probably want to add tests or specs for your new task.
You can find existing specs for scheduler_daemon in the scheduler_daemon/spec folder.

Be sure to copy them to your spec folder if you're using rspec.
